## Are the Gods Perfect?

The Majic Realm is a very large and complicated world. While the Gods do strive to test all of their works thoroughly to make sure that all that they create is perfect, it will happen that there is an occasional oversight. Also, creations have been known to be corrupted by the Dark Gods so as to function in an unexpected way when subjected to conditions that were not anticipated by their makers.

Some mistakes can be as simple as a misspelled word, others can be as major as a loophole that allows you to buy an item from a store and sell it back for more than you bought it.

Should you happen to stumble across such a "mistake" over the course of your journeys in the Majic Realm, we ask that you please report them to Customer Support immediately. They will make sure that the appropriate priest is informed, and that the proper offerings are made to rectify the situation.

## The Wrath of the Godâ€¦ Can Be a Dangerous Thing

There are those of you who will occasionally stumble upon a major oversight: one that will give you an advantage over the other denizens of the Majic Realm. It could be something that allows you to easily amass great wealth, or something that gives you an edge in battle, or something else altogether.

- **a)** In the spirit of fair play, it is not right to exploit a mistake that others do not know about to advance yourself.
  
- **b)** When something is used for a purpose for which it was never intended there are sometimes repercussions.
  
- **c)** The Gods are very busy working on the Majic Realm.
  
- **d)** If the other reasons listed above fail to move you, perhaps this might. The Gods get very displeased when mortals take it into their heads to toy with the delicate balance of their world.

## The Gods Can Be Generous

As an added incentive, the Gods often reward those mortals with whom they are pleased with some gift fitting to the action. Those who don't use an unknown "mistake" for their personal benefit, but rather inform the Gods of its existence, will often receive a token of appreciation. This is not a certainty, nor is it something to be expected or demanded, but it is usually the case.
