The world of the Majic Realm is a dangerous place filled with hideous monsters, deadly traps, and even a few other players who might covet your belongings. Sooner or later a fate every player must face is the death of his or her character. 

The good news is that in the Realm, death does not necessarily spell the end of all that you have accomplished. When every character is born, they are baptized by one of the major temples of the realm. As the result of an ancient covenant between the Gods, the temples all co-operate in trying to bring the character back from death. In addition, an adventurer can change his temple affiliation by praying at the altar of a new temple.

## What happens when your character dies?

When you are killed, your soul leaves your body and begins its long journey to the home of the Gods. The temples all have a powerful spell in effect which searches for disembodied souls and exerts a pull on them, much like the pull which draws them to their final home in the afterlife. The soul, approaching the light given off by the temples, and thinking it is nearing the afterlife, is drawn in by the priests who perform a resurrection and return the character to life. 

The bad news is that each time that a character is resurrected, the bond between its soul and the afterlife becomes stronger, and eventually the temples are simply unable to exert enough pull to save the individual from final death. 

The number of times a character can die is a function of their race. Elves for instance can return from death 12 times, while orcs, being less attuned to nature and life can only return 7 times. Other races fall somewhere in between. 

There is indeed hope for a mortal who is running low on lives. It is a well documented fact that when a player achieves another rank of skill in their chosen profession, they are granted another full span of lives. It is an age-old source of debate among sages as to whether this is a result of the increased confidence and strengthening of spirit that comes from achieving a higher station, or whether it is a gift from the Gods to encourage mortals to strive for greatness. Whatever the truth may be, the end result is the same: every time your character gains another level of experience, your full allotment of lives will be reset. 

## Final death

So, what happens if you don't make it to the next level? Unfortunately, we all have to die sometime. Being aware of this fact, most denizens of the Majic Realm prepare for this eventuality by training a relative or an apprentice to follow in their footsteps after they are gone. It is assumed that this student is given instruction in the characters "off time" and therefore gains some amount of skill during the course of your characters career. 

Therefore, when you die, your player is able to take over the role of this apprentice and follow in the footsteps of the old character, or perhaps seek a completely different fate. Since this other character is just a part-time pupil, his skills are obviously less refined than those of your late-great hero (or villain) and therefore he will begin his career with as much experience as your previous character would have needed to achieve roughly half the level he or she had at the time of death. 

In other words, if your late character was a 10th level warlock, then his apprentice (your new character) would have the same amount of experience that the warlock would have needed to achieve level 5. Therefore, though your new character may be considerably less skilled than his or her predecessor, at least not all has been lost. 

## Death by extreme violence

It happens on occasion that a character suffers so much trauma (overkill if you will) at the time of death that the priests are unable to safely draw the soul back to the temple. In these unfortunate cases the best they can do is to attempt to resurrect the soul in its current location. This will occasionally result in a character being reborn in the place of his recent death, or in a room relatively close to that locale. In these cases, there is little that can be done save to make the best of the situation. In most cases, it is superior to the alternative, which is to fail to resurrect the soul altogether and have it continue on it's journey into the afterlife. 

## Gaining lives

Those who are low on lives yet have far to go before achieving their next level are not entirely without hope. There are a number of (rare) majical talismans and devices that can be found throughout the realm which have the power of restoring lives. It is possible, though not likely, that a character facing extinction may stumble across one of these items, or perhaps may arrange to buy or trade for one from another denizen of the realm. Slim hope perhaps, but some hope is better than none.
