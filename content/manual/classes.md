## Warriors

These are the pure fighting men of the Majic Realm. They can wear all normal types of armour and weapons, including plate mail and two-handed weapons, and many majical ones as well. Their skill with weapons is one of the best and they are often in the front lines of an adventuring party guarding the mages and more fragile spellcasters from direct contact with the monsters. As they advance in levels, the number of attacks they get in a combat round increases, as well as their probability of hitting their target. Warriors tend to be tough in a fight, and advance personal levels quickly.

## Sorcerers

Sorcerers are those individuals who are trained in the manipulation of raw majic. Rather than earning their glory in the front lines of combat, they prefer to overcome their enemies using majical spells. Due to the nature of these spells, they are unable to wear armor, as this would impede their movements. Likewise, the rigorous study required to become skilled in this profession doesn't allow them time for weapons training or exercise. Sorcerers are one of the weakest classes when it comes to hand-to-hand combat, but their spells make up for this. They have a broad selection of spells, but they tend towards an offensive nature. Sorcerers have a hard time of it at low level if they have no one around who can protect them. But no other class can match the majical power they wield when they achieve the higher levels.

## Priests

These are the religious men of the land, able to call upon the might of their God to aid them or their friends in time of need. Though many priests are peaceful and abhor bloodshed, those that travel about with adventurers tend to be members of the more militant branches of their orders. These priests tend to be steeped in the rituals of their religion, and while these may vary from religion to religion, some are constant. For instance, for reasons lost in the distant past, most shun the use of any edged or pointed weapons. They can wear armour as heavy as chain mail and carry shields. They can also throw majic spells, mostly of a curative or protective nature, but with some offensive capability.

## Thieves

Members of this class tend to be a self-interested lot, skilled in the arts of stealth, opening doors, picking pockets, and disarming traps. As a result of their line of work, thieves occasionally have to fight, and thus have some skill at it, but they are unable to use two handed weapons since these would hinder their stealth. Likewise, they are restricted to wearing leather armor, and other forms of armor that do not hinder their movements or make a great deal of noise. Though they advance in personal levels very quickly, thieves tend to be weak in combat. They also have the ability to backstab, but only if they are undetected. Thieves make excellent explorers and scouts. They can slip past monsters undetected, and strike from surprise for considerable damage. They can get into and out of most places damage free (without having to bruise their shoulder breaking down doors or getting blasted by traps) and can often loot a treasure trove without disturbing the guardian monsters.

## Monks

Monks are best described as the ancient shaolin priests of old. They have many of the skills of a thief, yet their religious meditations and discipline grants them access to spells of a priestly nature. These thief-priests are somewhat better than their two component classes when it comes to fighting in that their dodging skill makes them harder to hit as their level increases, and their speed and damage when hitting with their hands does as well. This profession combines the many useful abilities of a thief with the power to heal, and superior combat ability.

## Ninja

Members of ancient assassin guilds, the ninja have traditionally practiced the arts of stealth and assassination, honing these skills to a razor's edge. Ninja are able to use all weapons, and have a great deal of skill in moving silently and picking locks. Their skill with weapons also allows them to swing to kill on an opponent, giving a good chance of inflicting a great deal of damage with a single blow. Since their skills require speed and stealth, they are unable to use armor better than robes, but they get harder to hit as they advance in levels. Ninjas are a hybrid between warriors and thieves. They get most of the abilities of both, but they pay for this mix by taking more than twice as many experience points to go up a level. Ninjas, like thieves, make excellent explorers, and their skill with weapons allows them to fight their way out of a situation if they have to. The only disadvantage they have over warriors and thieves is that they progress in levels so slowly.

## Barbarians

These nomadic tribesmen from the outlands are warriors who have learned their skills of fighting, not from a school, but from battling fierce monsters on a daily basis just to survive. They are able to use any weapons skillfully, and can wear any armor, but often shun heavy armor preferring the improved mobility, and increased stealth of the softer armour types. Due to their harsh lifestyle, they possess great stamina, since those who are weak never live to become adults. They are also a superstitious lot, and their religion teaches them to despise all things majical. Barbarians are without question the best pure fighters in the Majic Realm. They are tougher than warriors when it comes to hit points, have better chances of hitting their opponents, and both their speed of attacks and chance of hitting goes up more quickly than anyone else. The disadvantage of this profession is that they require more experience to progress in levels than a normal warrior, and that they don't have access to majic items. At low levels, the lack of majic is a negligible loss, due to the scarcity of such items, but as they achieve higher levels this will start to mean a lot more.

## Samurai

Samurai are warriors that are skilled in the martial arts. These players are known for their skills with both weapons and hand to hand combat. Because of the freedom of movement needed for their style of fighting, they cannot wear any armor heavier than leather, but their skill at parrying the weapons of their opponents, and dodging makes them harder and harder to hit as they gain skill. like ninja's, they can do critical blows, and their study of philosophy enables them to utilize priest spells as well. These characters are a hybrid between priests and warriors and combine the skills of both classes quite effectively. They fight like warriors but benefit from the fact that they can heal themselves when they get wounded and press on. The disadvantage they face is the high amount of experience they need to gain levels, almost thrice that of a straight warrior.

## Sages

Sages are specialists in majic and are students of both sorcery and of priestly majic. They can cast both sorcery spells and priest spells. As with sorcerers, sages have very poor combat skills, and rely on spells to get along. Though sages benefit greatly from their ability to cast spells of both types, they progress in levels more slowly than either. This is a potent class due to the combination of both offensive and defensive spells, but it is also extremely slow in terms of gaining levels. High level sages are deadly opponents, for those who have the patience to make it.

## Warlocks

Members of this profession have learned to combine the use of sorcery with weapons and can utilize both skillfully. They have all the benefits of warriors with regards to combat skills, and those of sorcerers with regards to majic powers. Their only loss insofar as their warrior skills is that their spellcasting skills prevent them from wearing armour more restrictive than chainmail. Sorcerers have the disadvantage of poor hit points, low armour protection and poor combat skills; the fighter side of their training makes up for all these deficiencies quite effectively. Experience progression is slow, but not as bad as many of the other hybrid professions.

## Rangers

Members of this profession have historically lived in the wilds in clans devoted to protecting nature. Through their years of communing with nature, rangers discover many of the more powerful secrets of the world, both sorcerous and priestly. Their nomadic outdoor life, and their spellcasting skills require that they wear light armor, no better than leather, but they can use any weapons. This profession encompasses the skills of warriors, sorcerers, and priests in a single package. This combination is without question the most powerful profession to be, especially at high levels of experience, but their level advancement is also the slowest in the Majic Realm due to the sheer volume of what they must learn.

## Jesters

Jesters are those members of the thief class who have taken to the study of sorcery to use majical spells to augment their ability to steal. Some thieves discovered early on that the ability to make themselves invisible, see in the dark, detect majic, and other spells of a sorcerous nature gave them a considerable edge over their guild brethren who did not share these skills. They share the same armour and weapon restrictions as normal thieves and combine all the abilities of both sorcerers and thieves. Their physical combat is no better than that of thieves, but their access to the full array of offensive sorcery spells makes them formidable opponents, though they do tend to advance in levels slowly.

## Spellsingers

Also known as "bards", these characters are musicians who have taken up adventuring. They share some of the characteristics of warriors, thieves, sorcerers and priests.

## Knights

A knight in the strictest sense is a champion of a particular God and imbued with powers by that God to go out and perform deeds which that deity would smile upon. The deity of "good" in Draconia is Elok, while Drakkar represents neutrality and Cthog the vilest of evil.

Henceforth, knights will have to choose a patron deity and seek their training at the temple of that deity. Caldwell will continue to train "good" knights, while neutrals will be trained by Gwendolyn at the temple of Drakkar at Rowan and dark knights will learn under the tutelage of Cthog in his hidden temple below the city.

At lower levels, the temple they pray at doesn't matter much, except in a role-playing sense and the Gods are generous in letting fledgeling adventurers choose their path in life. But, as they grow in power, their time to make a choice draws nearer.

Any knights who achieve the level of 8 or higher will find themselves the recipient of a 'gift' from their patron deity, passed on to them by the trainer. The nature of the gift may vary, but typically it will be in the form of majical armour or weapons. As the knight grows in the worship of his chosen God, the potency of these items will increase as well. The ultimate goal for a knight is to become the avatar of his chosen deity.

The colours of Elok are white and gold and are symbolic of light and purity. Knights of Elok should strive to remain good in thought and in deed. Those that stray from this path may find that the gifts given to them by their deity will reject them until they have managed to atone for their sins. Knights of Elok should seek to do good wherever they can, for in doing so they improve the quality of life of not only themselves but of those around them.

The colour of Drakkar is blood red and is symbolic of the great dragon God himself. Knights of Drakkar feel that a balance between good and evil must be maintained as both are a necessary part of the whole. Servants of Drakkar must tread the often difficult path between good and evil, struggling not to stray too far to either side. Knights of Drakkar are often mediators for disputes and try to act as a moderating influence for those around them.

The colour of Cthog is black as the lightless void of the abyss wherein he dwells and is symbolic of darkness and evil. Those dark knights which follow his path seek ultimate power at any price. and those that stand in their way are to be disposed of by whatever means are at hand. Most knights of Cthog understand that killing is not an end in itself, but a means of achieving ultimate power and domination over others. In unity there is strength, therefore they spread chaos and disorder wherever possible so as to weaken their enemies and facilitate their removal.

Serving a deity and accepting his gifts does not come without its price. That price is that you must strive to adhere to the mandates of your God. For this reason it is important that you make the right choice from the start. If you choose relics of evil and then turn to good, you may do so but those items which you gained in your service to the dark one will reject your touch and deny you their use until you return to the proper path.

Knights of Elok who become wanted, Knights of Cthog who become unwanted or Knights of Drakkar who stray too far to either extreme will find themselves unable to utilize the relics of that particular God. They may of course choose not to use them at all and follow their own path. By doing so, they lose some power, but gain some freedom over their own actions. The ultimate choice is theirs.

Of all the relics given out by the Gods, those of the dark knights are without question the most potent. This does not necessarily mean that Cthog is more powerful than his counterparts, rather it reflects the nature of the sacrifices that must be made by the wearer. A dark knight is a lonely figure, friend to few and trusted by none. Nearly every hand is turned against them and they often lead a hunted existence. Of all the knights, the dark knights have the most power and pay the highest price to obtain it.

All of the items received when training in the service of a deity are majical in nature and superior in virtually every way to their mundane counterparts. Some of them even bestow additional powers according to the nature of the deity they represent. I will elaborate no further on their abilities but leave you to learn of them on your own and experience the thrill of discovery.

Remember that these items are for serving the deity in question and not a mere by-product of being a knight. To this day, knights have been a shadow of what they could be. Those who turn now to the worship of one of the Gods, even if they have already passed the level at which initiates are normally accepted, will be taken in and receive gifts as well.
