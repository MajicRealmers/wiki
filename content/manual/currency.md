## Types of Currency

While many transactions in the Majic Realm are done by barter, there are four main types of currency which are accepted by the stores and banks of Draconia. These are, in order of value from least to most:

- Copper Drabs
- Silver Royals
- Gold Sovereigns
- Platinum Imperials

## Rates of Exchange

The copper coin is the least valuable coin, being 1/10th the value of a silver royal. Ten silver royals are equivalent to a gold sovereign and 100 gold sovereigns equal a single platinum imperial.

Prices in stores are normally given in gold, with fractions of silver and copper shown after a decimal place. For example, an item that has a price of 6.52gp is worth 6 gold, 5 silver, and 2 coppers. In other words, if you think of copper as pennies, silver as dimes, and gold as loons (Dollars), then you understand the way the money system in the Realm works.

For those fantasy purists who dislike the prices in the Majic Realm resembling current day dollars and cents, we have used this format because it is one that everyone can relate to, and which is easy to understand.

Platinum Imperials are very rare, and you will usually only see them when you withdraw large sums from the bank. Stores will accept platinum coinage but will never give change in it.

## Other Types of Currency

There are also gems, and pieces of jewelry that can be used as currency but be warned that not all shops will accept gems, and you may be required to use coins.
