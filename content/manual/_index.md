The Majic Realm is a game of fantasy, adventure, and exploration. You will have the opportunity to create a character and enter a world of swords and sorcery where you can join with other people from other parts of the city, or even from other cities. There you will have the opportunity to assume the role of a powerful lizard man warrior, a greedy dwarf thief, a sly elven mage, or just about any other kind of character you can imagine.

Upon exiting the training course you will find yourself in the Golden Goblet tavern. This popular drinking establishment is the preferred hangout for most of the locals, and you are likely to find a crowd of people already there when you arrive. Talk to the people, maybe make some new friends, wander around and explore. A wonderful new world of adventure awaits you!

Below you will find a series of help files designed to let you know just how things work in this massive game! Remember, it may look complicated, but then usually the good things in life are! Above all, remember to have fun and enjoy the experience.
