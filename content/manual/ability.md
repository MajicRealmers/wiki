There are six ability scores which are used to represent the physical and mental attributes of your avatar in the Majic Realm. These are Strength, Intelligence, Piety, Charm, Stamina, and Agility. Each of these abilities will be discussedexplained in detail and some effort will be made to explain what aspects of a character will be affected by each.

**STRENGTH** is a measure of an avatar's physical musculature. It affects your probability of breaking down doors, the amount of damage you will inflict with a physical blow, and how much you can carry. This is important to all avatars, but primarily to those who rely on physical combat.

**INTELLIGENCE** is a measure of mental aptitude and indicates speed of thought, quality of memory, and general intuitiveness. It affects spellcasting ability, stealth, figuring out mechanisms like locks or traps and observation ability. This is an important attribute for spellcasters and thieves, as a clear and well focused mind is essential to both priest and sorcerer spells, and a smart thief tends to live longer. ðŸ˜Š

**PIETY** is a measure of a playersâ€™ faith and willpower. It affects spellcasting ability, observation skills and determines how in touch one is with the Gods. This attribute is most useful to any players who wish to cast Priestly spells, or who wish to be observant.

**CHARM** reflects a player's physical attractiveness, persuasiveness, and luck. Though it isn't an actual requirement for any of the classes, it is helpful to all of them. In addition to allowing you to haggle better prices out of the merchant in the shops, it also affects a number of other abilities or chances in the Majic Realm, like avoiding blows, taking damage, or finding things of value. This ability helps people lead a charmed life as well as to be charming.

**STAMINA** is the measure of a playersâ€™ physical toughness. Not to be confused with strength which is a measure of how much you can lift, stamina is more a matter of how many times you can lift it. It directly affects the health of a player making them harder to kill and makes them more resistant to the effects of poisons or other physical attacks. This is a helpful attribute for all classes, but more for people who expect to be in the front lines fighting.

**DEXTERITY** indicates the reflexes, manual dexterity, and coordination of an avatar. The higher the agility, the more likely they are to hit an opponent,dodge out of the way of an attack or avoid a hostile spell. It is also used to determine the success of certain skills, such as picking locks, disarming traps, or stealth related abilities. This attribute is most helpful for people who use thieving skills or combat as part of their profession.
