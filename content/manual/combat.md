Combat with the use of SPELLS is a little more complicated...

There are three types of magic in The Majic Realm: SORCEROR and PRIEST SPELLS, and SPELLSINGER SONGS.

Not all classes can use spells. Some classes can only use their class-specific type of spells, while two classes can use both sorcerer and priest spells.

Only Spellsingers (Bards) can use Spellsinger songs.

While the existence of the following magical spells and songs is known, where to secure them for your own use is not always known. Spell shops, training rooms, dungeon hordes/treasures are all potential sources for you to explore and discover as you live and move through the different areas of The Majic Realm.

Casting or singing these songs takes energy, which is tracked on your stat bar as SP's on your STATLINE for Spell or Song Points). The cost to cast for each is shown below.
