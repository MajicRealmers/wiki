Commands in the Majic Realm are (for the most part) common-sense English words that one would associate with the action you are trying to perform. 

Given below is a summary of all the commonly used commands in the game, followed by some details on how to figure out some of the less commonly used ones. There are a number of things that the game looks for when you type a command, and a proper understanding of these rules is essential for you to get anywhere in the game.

### Shortcuts

You do not have to type out an entire word for the game to understand what you want. All you must do is type enough letters for it to figure out what you are trying to do. For example, instead of typing `ATTACK RASPUTIN` you can get away with `A RAS` and the game will figure out the rest. This doesn't mean that you can always get away with a one letter shortcut, sometimes you need to type more so that the game can differentiate between similar commands. With a bit of experimentation will soon learn the minimum number of letters you need to enter for any given command.

### Ignored Words

In the interest of conforming to proper English, we allow people to type in full sentence, but you should be aware that the words (the, and, to, at, of, on, a, off) are ignored. In other words, `GET THE GOLD` is the same as `GET GOLD` to the game. Using full sentences is a matter of preference, but it saves time if you don't.
