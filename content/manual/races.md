The tables listed below show the differences between the races of the Majic Realm. All races have the same maximum points when it comes to their abilities, it is only the distribution that changes.

For instance, humans have no additional strengths or weaknesses when it comes to their abilities, while other races may excel in one only to pay for it with another. 

HP indicates how many bonus hit points a character of that race receives to his hit points. The more "+"'s the better, while "-" indicates this class is slightly more fragile. For example, a Halfling will generally have the lowest hit points, while a Lizard Man will have the most. 

EXPERIENCE indicates how much more (or less) experience a player will need to go up in levels as a percentage.

**NOTE**: Please keep one thing in mind when choosing a character. Although we have made efforts to playtest all the above settings to ensure that game balance is maintained; it is impossible for us to check every combination or permutation of character under all conditions. Therefore, the management of ICE reserves the right to change any of the above data at any time, retroactively, if we feel that there is an imbalance in the game. Any such changes will be announced in the ICE forum, and the reason for the change.
