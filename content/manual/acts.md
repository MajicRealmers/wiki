(*Also known as:* Server Crashes)

It will occasionally happen that due to some bizarre twist of fate, the malicious act of a Dark God, or just plain bad luck, some misfortune will befall an avatar during his or her travels in the Majic Realm. It could be something as minor as appearing in the dungeon rather than the temple after you have been slain, or something as major as all of your gear and money vanishing into thin air. Remember that in a world of Majic, strange things happen, and though they tend to be rare, just like in real life, disasters occur, and often for no particular reason.

When something like this happens, it isn't necessarily your fault, nor is it necessarily the fault of the Sysop. Just like catching the flu the day of your wedding, or when lightning strikes your house (and it burns down). Life isn't always fair, and when you suffer a calamity, you make the best of the situation and get on with your life as best you can. 

If something unexpected happens to you, by all means – please inform customer support of what happened. Try to provide them with as many details as you can. They will hopefully prevent it from happening again but will not necessarily be able to repair what happened or replace whatever was lost.

ICE Customer Support is very, very, busy, and to have to replace all the things lost by bugs, perceived bugs, or by people who fraudulently claim to have encountered bugs, would tax their time to the point where they would be unable to do any real work on the system at all. In many cases, for ICS to replace something you legitimately lost, then he would open the door to dozens of daily claims for 'damages', many of which would be falsified, and others which would be legitimate game functions that were mistaken as a bug.  

The time just to write detailed answers to these letters, and to try to find the problem and fix it would be considerable. Therefore, as a general policy, understand that there will be no compensation forthcoming for lost time or damages suffered because of a crash or a system bug, except the knowledge that the sysops will see to fixing it as soon as you inform them of it.  

ALL reports of game issues must be sent to support@majicrealm.com to be considered, and only UNIQUE ITEM LOSSES will be considered (no guarantees!) For consideration of unique item restoration, provide screen shots, account number, character name, and time/date of crash via email to support@majicrealm.com.

We're sorry about this, we would like to make everyone happy, and we have tried to do just this in the past… but every time we "fixed" a person’s character, we got swamped with dozens of letters from other people all wanting similar changes and starting with "I heard you gave Bob...”

In short, "The management of ICE online assumes no responsibility for any damage or loss to people's characters or their items resulting from any system errors, bugs, or other such occurrences."
