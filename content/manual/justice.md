## What Happens When You Break The Law?

The system of justice in the Majic Realm is like a cross between a frontier town in the old west, and a medieval settlement, with a little bit of magic thrown in for good measure. The process of justice is fairly simple and goes as follows:

- People who commit crimes attain a certain amount of notoriety dependent on the severity of their crime. Eventually, when the number and or severity of the crimes reaches a certain point, the person in question becomes "Wanted".

- When someone is wanted, this indicates that the guardsmen in and around the city will recognize them as being a known felon and will attack them on sight. 
- Wanted individuals who continue to break the law, will soon find that they have attained the status of a "Criminal".

- Those rare individuals whose crimes are so heinous as to surpass being criminal, and yet who are lucky (or tough) enough to survive the guardsmen and roaming posses of citizens, earn the status of "Outlaw".

## How Does One Become Wanted?

There are various crimes for which a person will become wanted. The more obvious of these are:

- Stealing from stores.

- Pickpocketing citizens of the realm.

- Assaulting citizens of the realm.

- Casting offensive spells in a patrolled area.

To help prevent this sort of abuse, the city guard have several high-level wizards in their employ who constantly monitor suspected criminals.

## What To Do If You Become Wanted?

Those people who manage to become wanted, the best advice they could get is to keep a low profile until things cool down. 

- To become less wanted, you must simply survive long enough to work off your notoriety.

- For every hour (must be a full and unbroken hour IN the realm) you will see a message stating that you feel less evil.

**NOTE:** There are several places that people cannot wait in order to work off their notoriety. They include all clan lairs, arenas, taverns, and temples. In essence, you have to be in a place where others will be able to get at you in order to expiate your sins.
