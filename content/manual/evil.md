## What Is an Evil Avatar?

There are a number of twisted individuals who inhabit the alleys and byways of the Majic Realm. These are the people who actively seek to harm other travellers, take their money, or otherwise harm them for their own profit. The law enforcement officials of the city of Draconia have set up patrols to deter these evildoers, but as in real life, you just can't be safe everywhere. They will do anything and everything they can to do you in.

## Snares to Watch out for

### Tales of Fantastical Treasure Troves

An evil avatar may try to trick you with a story about a fabulous treasure, simply waiting to be plucked. Of course, your help is needed to be able to reach it...

### Luring Victims into Dangerous Areas

Evil characters can be deceptively friendly - if only to lure their victims into the sewers, or some other dismal area, to kill them...

### Insulting You until You Attack Them

People can't attack you in the patrolled areas of the city, however...

### Borrowing Equipment

Don't ever give anything of yours to someone you don't know...

### Cursed Items

Evil players have often tried offering cursed potions...

### Loading You up with Gear

Beware of people who load you up with a lot of gear...

## The Moral of the Story

Basically, the ways people can rip you off or trick you are as endless as people's imaginations. This just tips you off to some of the possibilities, and hopefully serves as a warning to you to be careful. Wandering the Majic Realm is sort of like wandering through New York at night...
