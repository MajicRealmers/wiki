The following commands deal with being able to communicate with other people in the game, or any of the various artificial people created by the game.

- The word "name" after a command means to insert the NAME of the person you wish to communicate with in its stead (eg: `telepath name` = `telepath bob`).
- The word "text" after a command means to insert whatever text you want to communicate in its stead (eg: `say text` = `say open sesame`).
- N & S are also used to refer to Name and Subject (eg: `ask N about S` = `Ask bartender about jobs`).
