## Game Etiquette

The Gods of the Majic Realm are fairly lax about who they allow to wander in their land. They realize that it takes many diverse types of people to make up a world, and even evil people have their place in the natural order of things. There are however certain commandments that they insist that travellers into the Majic Realm abide by.

### Thou shalt not prey on the novice

Thou shalt help them to the best of thine ability. The Gods do not frown on a person who kills another in the game per se, but they do frown upon those who go out of their way to kill NEW players...

### Thou shalt not repeatedly harass the same individual

While hassling someone else is a legitimate, and sometimes necessary course of action... 

### Thou shalt not have multiple identities

Each person is allowed a single account with which they can access The Realm...

### Thou shalt not use excessive profanity

The Gods acknowledge that people do swear...

### Thou shalt not choose stupid names

When you name a new character, you may call them whatever you like, with a few notable exceptions...

In short, the Majic Realm was created for the enjoyment of everyone, and though everyone has the right to play the game in their own way, that right ends when it begins to seriously hamper the right to enjoyment of others. If you see someone who is seriously breaching one of the above listed commandments, please send an email to support@majicrealm.com, and inform them of what is happening and who exactly is doing it. Please include as much information as you have, including your account number and your character name as well as whatever information you have on the individual you wish to report.

## Who to call for help?
The knights of the Gold Rose are players from all avenues of the Realm who dedicate much of their time to serving the citizens of Draconia. Although their primary mandate is to provide help and guidance to new users, they are often willing to lend a hand to other adventurers in need of assistance.  A true knight will have the title "Sir" or "Dame" in front of his or her name. 

Similarly, those individuals with a GOOD flag in front of their name are well-known and trusted throughout the Realm. If you need help, type WHO and if one of these individuals is in the realm, try telepathing them for help.

If you are being attacked in city, do not forget to PARRY and call for the POLICE!
